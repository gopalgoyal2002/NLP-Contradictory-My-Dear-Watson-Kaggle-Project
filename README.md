 The Challenge:
If you have two sentences, there are three ways they could be related: one could entail the other, one could contradict the other, or they could be unrelated. Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) is a popular NLP problem that involves determining how pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) are related.

Your task is to create an NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses. To make things more interesting, the train and test set include text in fifteen different languages! You can find more details on the dataset by reviewing the Data page.
